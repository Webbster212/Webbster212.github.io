Repl.it continued

In this weeks lesson we continued to look at Repl.it and began to try and write letters, specifically our name initials. We began by trying to write the letter 'A'  and working out all the angles needed to create the shape of the letter. Once we had done that we started to work on our initials mine being ‘BW’.  I started off by dointhe W because it was easier just working out the angles and lengths, and then I tried to do the B. I started off by creating a vertical line and then I struggled to work out how to draw the curves of a B so instead I did the best I could using straight lines. We also learnt about the pen.up code which allowed you to stop the drawing and move the turtle to make it start drawing at a different place. Overall I found this lesson quite difficult and struggled to draw the ‘B’.
