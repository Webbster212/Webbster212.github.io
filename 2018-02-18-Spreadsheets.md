Spreadsheets

IT lessons Summary

Over the past few weeks we have been learning about spreadsheets and how they are used. We have created our own virtual shop that could have the potential to be the system used in a real life shop. In our first lesson we focused on making sure our blogs worked correctly. We then started our work on spreadsheets by creating our stock that we would have in our shop and decided what the price would be. One key features of docs that we used was called V-lookup which basically searched certain areas of the spreadsheet for words or numbers that you want. For example if you started typing a word in a V-lookup box such as 'trousers' it will you give you a dropdown list of any words that include those letters in the area the V-lookup had specified. After weâ€™d finished figuring out V-lookup we gave wrote down how much of each item we had and hypothetically how many we would sell in a month. I than also wrote down a price of how much I bought each item for and subtracted that from the price I sold them giving me a margin for each item, and a total amount of money made. As a class we then got told to go into more detail, so I gave myself a rough monthly for the shop and the cost of employing two workers at different pay rates and hours. My final steps to complete my shop was working out the total profit monthly and annually. In our final week we began to look at how spreadsheets could be used in coding and decoding. Overall I found learning about spreadsheets extremely helpful and it will probably be extremely useful in future life.
