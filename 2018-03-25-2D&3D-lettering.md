2D&3D Lettering

In this weeks lesson we continued to look at lettering and began to make a 2D and a 3D letter 'T’. Creating the 2D letter was quite easy because it was essentially dealing with things that we had already learnt before with side lengths and angles. However when making the 3D letter we had to learn a new code which was called 'turtle.begin_()’ and whatever colour we wanted we could just put it between the brackets with speech marks around it. The fill tool made it alot easier to actually get the shape of what it would look like 3D instead of a bunch of overlapping lines. Overall I found the lesson really helpful and significantly improved my coding skill.
