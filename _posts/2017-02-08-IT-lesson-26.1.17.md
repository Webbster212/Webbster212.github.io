**It lesson 26.1.17**

In today's lesson we started something brand new. Our teacher, Mr Tansley, told us we had finishing modifying our website and were moving on to a project on fuse boxes. Fuse boxes are basically old computers with a program on it designed to help a child learn about coding. The first task was to set it up, me and my partner found this very difficult  but after around 10 minute we got it running.We were then given a booklet explaining what to do and how to start .I think my fuse box was broken because nothing seemed to work. We didnâ€™t get a lot of time to code but we had know learnt how to connect the fuse box up ready for next week.
