IT lesson 20.4.17

In today's lesson  we started something completely new for the new term. Our new teacher for this term,  Mr Keen, introduced to a website called codecademy. This website has many tutorials to help you learn most of the different coding languages. Today  just started off with the basics of Python. At the end of lesson we each checked how far we were through finishing the course. When I saw I was only 9% through I realised I had a long journey ahead of me. We ended the lesson by Mr Keen setting us the homework of doing 30 minutes more of codecademy.
