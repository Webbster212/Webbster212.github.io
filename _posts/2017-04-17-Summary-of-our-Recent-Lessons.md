Summary of our Recent Lessons

Over the past few weeks in IT we have been working on the same things. Over the weeks I started to forget about my blog post and ended up not posting my blogs, so to make up I decided to write one blog to summarize all the things we have been doing.

As you know from my last blog we are working on Fuzeboxes, which if you didn't know are basic computers designed to help kids learn how to code. We started off the process by following a book which gave us simple code for us to copy out. However we were not just copying the book also explained to us why we were putting in certain things. The first coding we did was simple commands such as, Print or Repeat and other things like that. The Print command told the Fuzebox that whatever the next words we typed it was to produce when we tried to run the program. We continued with these simple commands and code for a couple of weeks until we got used to it.

After that we moved onto lights and making bulbs light using code. We did this by telling the Fuzebox where the bulb was, the coordinates, so that it knew where to put the power. However me and my partner Tom, struggled on this as the bulbs were very fragile and extremely difficult to put in place.

The final thing we did was work with a robot arm. For this we needed to have different pieces of code for different pieces of the robot, such as the wrist, elbow and the claw. By the end we ended up with 75 lines of code to make it work. Making the robot arm work took many, many attempts but after a bit of help we manage to get it working and make the robot pick up a pencil using the commands we had given it.
