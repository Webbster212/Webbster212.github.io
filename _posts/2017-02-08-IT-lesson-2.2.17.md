**IT lesson 2.2.17**

This week, in our IT lesson we managed to set up our fuze boxes a lot quicker. This meant we had a lot more time to start coding. One thing that definitely helped was the fact that are fuze box wasn't broken. In the lesson we managed to make a lot of progress and had learned how to run a program. At the end of the lesson we had to save the work we had done onto a memory stick ready for next week.
