IT lesson 5.6.17

In today's lesson we spent the majority of the time talking about decomposition and what it is. Our teacher, Mr Keen, started us off with the simple task of explaining to a robot how to make a cup of tea. After a few wrong attempts, including mine, Mr Keen explained that the answer is actually extremely difficult. He said the each tiny movement would have to be explained to the robot such as turning on the tap and filling the kettle, even though these things are completely natural for humans to do for a robot they would’ve never seen a tap before and will not know what to do with it. Mr Keen then went on to explain that decomposing is basically breaking a big problem down to smaller parts to make the task seem more manageable, and plausible. He then used another example of explaining intricate detail: he ten told us to imagine explaining to a completely new boy in the school how to find a teacher. After some thought we realised it would be very difficult because he would have no idea what the teacher looked like and we couldn’t just say go to the staffroom because he wouldn’t know where it is. We finished off the lesson with Mr Keen telling us that if we ever come across a big problem always break it down to more manageable parts.
