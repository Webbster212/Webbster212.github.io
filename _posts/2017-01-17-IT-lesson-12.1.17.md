IT lesson 12.1.17

In today's lesson we continued to customize our website. We started off by recapping what we did last week. We then spent most of the lesson editing what our website would look like e.g background, type colour or font. I spent most of the lesson trying to get a new background. I found this quite infuriating because when I checked my website to see if it had worked many times it hadnâ€™t. Eventually by the end of the lesson I had got a background that I wanted and the font that I wanted.
