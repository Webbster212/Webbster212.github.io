Repl.it

In our first lesson back from half-term we began to look at something new called repl.it turtle. It is a tool designed to help with coding. At the start of the lesson, Mr Keen showed us the basics of what to do and how to work it and he asked us to create a code to draw any sided regular shape. At first I found it difficult and didn't understand but eventually I understood that you couldnâ€™t just tell the computer to draw a shape you have to give it variables and angles. After I had figured out how to do it and had created a piece of code where you only have to change the number of sides we began to make patterns out of the shapes. Overall I really enjoyed being introduced to Repl.it and found after a bit of struggle I figured out how to do it.
