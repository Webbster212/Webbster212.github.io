**IT lesson 5/1/17**

In today's lesson we completely restarted our github account, so that we could make a blogging page. We started off by logging onto our computers and then logging into Github. After this the class went through many stages to completely delete our website so we could start afresh. Once our website was deleted we had to create a new repository, we used the template from a repository called, Jekyll now. Once we had done this we went into the coding of our blog and changed all the details to suit ourselves, such as an avatar that fitted with your personality. When we had finally finished making changes to our website we hit 'Publishâ€™, which meant our website was now on the internet for people to look at. Finally we went onto our website and checked to make sure everything looked okay.
